# planeauth
A Floatplane authentication library<br>
**Heavily inspired by [aaronjamt](https://github.com/aaronjamt) who made [this pr](https://github.com/Flonja/sinkingchat/pull/2)**.

### Running the example
```sh
go build github.com/flonja/planeauth
./planeauth
```
### Obtaining your token
You'll need the `sails.sid` cookie from a logged in browser to use the functions of this library, sadly there is no other way that I know of...
